## WTF
So, this is what everyone was waiting for. The thing you are missing basically your whole effing life. Another blogging system. BOOM! Another minimalistic, fast, easy to use, simple blogging system which is using the markdown format (CommonMark to be specific) to store it's posts and pages. If you think "Hey, this sounds just like Ghost!" you're clever, because this is what I try to accomplish. Except this buddy is written in PHP. No, not the functional, messy, awful PHP, but the OOP PHP, with namespaces, design patterns, unit tests and anything between and beyond.

## Why?
Great question. For one, I needed a project. I needed something to do except for my part-time job and my full-time studies. Another reason is that I think there are people who want a system just as Ghost, but don't want to pay for Ghost Pro, maybe because they already have a web server or something and that server doesn't have support for node.js or whatever.
Also, impress also wants to prove that PHP isn't as awful as many people think. It can be just as good as many other languages. PHP made incredible progress in the last few years and I'm confident this will continue.

## How?
With Laravel. This is my first "serious" Laravel project. I'm a little afraid that it won't fulfill my performance whishes, but I really like their philosophy. Some of their "design decisions" are strange, such as this whole facades thing, which screws up the code completion of IDEs, although there are some plugins/helper files/whatever for PhpStorm (PhpStorm <3). But again, I really like the way they want people to create awesome apps.

## Progression
Will be slow. As I said, I'm currently studying full-time and have a part-time job. These two certainly have top priority, which means there may be times/weeks/months when this baby won't get any love from me. It's no big project by any means, but this is kind of the reason I want to make it as perfect as I can.
