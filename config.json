 | Impress configuration
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 | This file contains all settings which can also be accessed and configured
 | from inside the app. You may also overwrite any other settings from
 | the Laravel framework and it's packages (found on config/*.php
 | files). So be careful what you type inhere, it could break
 | your website!
 |
 | Make sure to "flatten" the dimensions of the settings when overwriting
 | them. So if you overwrite a setting from config/mail.php, for
 | example this one:
 |
 | [
 |    'from' => [
 |        'address' => null,
 |        'name' => null
 |    ]
 | ]
 |
 | You'd write it in here like this (since this is JSON, you must use
 | double quotes):
 |
 | "mail.from.address": "some@email.com",
 | "mail.from.name": "Peter Smith",
 |
 | Comments are straight up stolen from Laravel :)
